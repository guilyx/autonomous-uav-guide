# Autonomous UAV Algorithm Handbook

This handbook presents the autonomous UAV stack as a technical reference: algorithm design, mathematical formulations, implementation notes, tuning strategy, and empirical behavior.
Use the sidebar as the primary table of contents.

## Reading Guide

- [Getting Started](/guide/getting-started): repository setup, execution flow, and notation baseline.
- [Architecture](/guide/architecture): subsystem boundaries and data flow.
- [Algorithm Atlas](/simulations/): domain index with article links and media evidence.

## Chapter Structure

- Each chapter starts with problem framing, assumptions, and model definitions.
- Each algorithm page includes derivations, practical tuning, and failure analysis.
- Every article links to reproducible media hosted via `media.githubusercontent.com`.

## Suggested Learning Path

1. Foundations (`Getting Started`, `Architecture`)
2. Estimation and state representation
3. Control, path tracking, and trajectory layers
4. Planning and environment interaction
5. Perception, sensing, and swarm coordination
