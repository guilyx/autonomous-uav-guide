# Swarm

Swarm coordination studies decentralized policies for formation, flocking, consensus, and area coverage.
The chapter emphasizes local rules, communication assumptions, and emergent global behavior.

## Core Questions

- What information must be shared for stable formation behavior?
- How do local interaction rules scale with team size?
- Which methods retain robustness under dropouts and disturbances?

## Algorithms

- [Reynolds Flocking](/simulations/swarm/reynolds-flocking)
- [Consensus Formation](/simulations/swarm/consensus-formation)
- [Virtual Structure](/simulations/swarm/virtual-structure)
- [Leader-Follower](/simulations/swarm/leader-follower)
- [Potential Swarm](/simulations/swarm/potential-swarm)
- [Voronoi Coverage](/simulations/swarm/voronoi-coverage)

## Prerequisites

- Graph theory basics for multi-agent systems
- Consensus and stability concepts
- Potential fields and geometric formation models
