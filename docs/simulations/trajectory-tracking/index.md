# Trajectory Tracking

Trajectory tracking closes the loop on full-state references under nonlinear rigid-body dynamics.
This chapter compares model-based and sampling-based controllers for aggressive and robust flight.

## Core Questions

- How should model mismatch be managed online?
- What is the cost of long horizons in constrained control?
- When does sample-based control outperform linearized feedback?

## Algorithms

- [Feedback Linearisation](/simulations/trajectory-tracking/feedback-linearisation)
- [NMPC](/simulations/trajectory-tracking/nmpc)
- [MPPI](/simulations/trajectory-tracking/mppi)

## Prerequisites

- Nonlinear state-space modeling
- Optimal control and receding horizon ideas
- Real-time numerical optimization constraints
