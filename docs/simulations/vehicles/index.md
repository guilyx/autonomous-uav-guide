# Vehicles

Vehicle modeling defines the dynamics and actuator mappings that bound every algorithm in this handbook.
This chapter includes multirotor, fixed-wing, and hybrid VTOL operating regimes.

## Core Questions

- Which assumptions are valid for each airframe class?
- How do actuator constraints reshape feasible trajectories?
- What model simplifications preserve control fidelity?

## Algorithms

- [Quadrotor Dynamics](/simulations/vehicles/quadrotor-dynamics)
- [Fixed-Wing Flight](/simulations/vehicles/fixed-wing-flight)
- [VTOL Transition](/simulations/vehicles/vtol-transition)

## Prerequisites

- Newton-Euler rigid body dynamics
- Aerodynamic force and moment modeling
- Control allocation and actuator limits
