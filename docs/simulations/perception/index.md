# Perception

Perception transforms raw sensing into map, localization, and task-relevant scene understanding.
The chapter emphasizes probabilistic mapping and vision-in-the-loop feedback.

## Core Questions

- Which state representations remain observable with sparse landmarks?
- How should map confidence be accumulated and decayed?
- How do perception delays impact closed-loop control?

## Algorithms

- [EKF-SLAM](/simulations/perception/ekf-slam)
- [Occupancy Mapping](/simulations/perception/occupancy-mapping)
- [Sensor Suite Fusion](/simulations/perception/sensor-suite)
- [Visual Servoing](/simulations/perception/visual-servoing)

## Prerequisites

- Probabilistic robotics fundamentals
- Camera projection and feature tracking
- Grid-map and landmark-map representations
